# üìö C++ Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of my **C++ DSA mini-projects** and exercises developed during my academic coursework. Each module demonstrates core data structures and algorithmic techniques including linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, matrix operations, and priority queues. These are not just practice codes but carefully crafted implementations with proper logic and structure.

---

## üìÇ Project Categories & Descriptions

---

### üîó 1. **Linked Lists**

#### ‚û§ `Movie-Ticket-Reservation.cpp`

Simulates a simple movie ticket reservation system using **singly linked lists** to manage bookings and cancellations.

> Includes: Add, delete, display booking data.

---

### üß† 2. **Priority Queue**

#### ‚û§ `Task-Manager-Priority-Queue.cpp`

Implements a task manager that uses a **priority queue** (via heap/linked structure) to organize tasks based on priority.

> Real-world simulation of task scheduling logic.

---

### üî¢ 3. **Matrix Operations**

#### ‚û§ `Matrix-Addition-Subtraction-Multiplication.cpp`

Performs all major matrix operations using **2D arrays**, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

> Covers core concepts of matrix manipulation.

#### ‚û§ `Matrix-Diagonal-Sum.cpp`

Calculates the **sum of primary and secondary diagonals** of a square matrix.

> Strengthens grasp on indexing logic in 2D arrays.

#### ‚û§ `Rotate-Matrix-90.cpp`

Rotates a matrix **90 degrees clockwise** without using extra space.

> Demonstrates in-place algorithm understanding.

---

### üîÅ 4. **Recursion**

#### ‚û§ `Tower-of-Hanoi.cpp`

Classic recursive algorithm solving the Tower of Hanoi problem for **n disks**.

> Enhances conceptual clarity of recursion and stack behavior.

---

### üß± 5. **Stacks & Queues**

#### ‚û§ `Infix-to-Postfix.cpp`

Converts infix expressions into **postfix notation** using stacks.

> Includes proper precedence and associativity handling.

#### ‚û§ `Infix-to-Prefix.cpp`

Performs infix to **prefix conversion**, using reversed infix logic and stack-based parsing.

> Enhances expression evaluation concepts.

#### ‚û§ `Stack-Implementation.cpp`

Custom implementation of a **stack from scratch** using arrays.

> Basic operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty, isFull.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **C++ (C++11/14)**
* **Standard Template Library (STL)** where needed
* Basic terminal I/O (`cin`, `cout`)
* No external libraries used

---

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

* Strong hands-on understanding of core **data structures**
* Improved **algorithmic thinking**
* Application of DSA in real-world inspired mini projects
* Debugging and writing **clean, modular code**

---

## üìé How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Cpp-Projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to any project folder and compile using:

   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output  
   ./output
   ```

> Each file is independent and self-contained for compilation.

## üìå Note

This repo is created to showcase my journey of learning **DSA in C++**. It's not meant as production-grade code but rather a portfolio of my academic mini-projects and problem-solving efforts.
