# 🎟️ Movie Ticket Reservation System (C++)

A beginner-friendly **console-based movie ticket reservation system** written in **C++**, using **linked lists** and **dynamic memory allocation**. This project demonstrates core data structures, pointer logic, and basic user interaction — perfect for students learning C++.

---

## 📌 Core Features

✅ Reserve a movie ticket (enter ticket number, movie name, customer name)  
✅ Display all current reservations  
✅ Cancel a reservation by ticket number  
✅ Menu-driven interface  
✅ No external libraries — pure C++ with `struct` and `pointers`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `struct` for defining node schema  
- Singly Linked List implementation  
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)  
- Pointer manipulation and traversal  
- Basic input/output handling (`cin`, `getline`)  
- Condition checking and loop controls
